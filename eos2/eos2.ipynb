Considering a fully degenerate non-relativistic equation of state for both, which differs only on the mass of the degenerate particle (with a ratio between neutron and electron mass of $m_n/m_e\\sim 2000$), what is the ratio between the radii of both objects at a fixed mass? For this remember that for $P\\propto \\rho^{5/3}$ the solution to the equations of stellar structure can be determined from the Lane-Emden equation for an $n=1.5$ polytrope, with\n",
