    "Let us do something more exotic. Consider a black hole which accretes an amount $\\Delta m$ of mass. Under the right conditions, a lot of energy can be produced in this way, releasing a significant fraction of the rest mass energy $\\eta \\Delta m c^2$, where $\\eta\\sim 0.1$ depends on the black hole spin. If a black hole accretes mass at a rate $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{acc}$ then it has a corresponding luminosity $L_\\mathrm{acc}=\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{acc}\\eta c^2$. Find an expression for the critical value of $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{acc}$ at which the luminosity released from accretion matches the Eddington luminosity. This is known as the Eddington limit for the accretion rate $\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{Edd}$, and beyond this limit accretion into the black hole is suppresed. How long would it take for a $10 M_\\odot$ black hole to grow into a supermassive $10^9M_\\odot$ black hole while accreting at this rate?\n",
