    "Just as in the previous session we will be making use of version 15140 of MESA, which is already installed on the lab computers. To be able to run MESA from a folder of your choice, you need to set the Linux environment variables to tell your terminal where to find the software. To do so, open a terminal with ```ctrl+shift+T``` and type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Set the environment variables\n",
    "module load mesasdk\n",
    "module load mesa\n",
    "# Check that everything is correct\n",
    "echo $MESA_DIR\n",
    "echo $MESASDK_VERSION\n",
    "```\n",

    "Beware that the `module load` commands are specific to the setup of the computers at the Institute of Astronomy. If you are running MESA locally on your computer you need to follow the usual instructions to install and run MESA models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some specific performance tipd you can use at the computers of the Institute of Astronomy to improve the runtime of your simulations. These should not be necessary when running things locally on your own machine. Make sure you use all cores available in your system. By running `htop` on your terminal you can see the number of cores available, and then in the terminal where you will run the simulations do\n",

The second performance tip is to make use of the local storage on the computers rather than network storage which is much slower. Local storage is contained in `/scratch`, so you can start the lab by moving into that directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd /scratch\n",
    "```\n",
    "MESA also stores files containing information from the equation of state, rates and opacities. By default these will be stored on your home folder which needs to go through the network. To switch these to use `/scratch` you can include the following within the `&star_job` section of any inlist you run (`[...]` stands for other parts within this section, you do not need to copy that):\n",

    "### Preliminary instructions\n",
    "Download the input files {download}`from here<./lab2_input.tar.xz>`. You can then create a folder for your work from a terminal and uncompress the input files there:\n",

    "\n",
    "After uncompressing the input file, you will have four folders corresponding to each part of the lab. Within each of this folder there is a template for that part. We strongly recommend not modifying this template folder. Instead, copy the template for each simulation you run, for example you could copy and run the first template by doing (do not do this yet though, read through the instructions for the first part down below first):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd part1_convergence\n",

    "Where the exact name you give to the copied folder is your choice. To edit your inlists, from a work directory you can run (replacing gedit with a different editor if you prefer):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "gedit inlist_project\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For all parts of this lab, whenever you need to use the same template to run more than one simulation, you can adjust the options `filename_for_profile_when_terminate`, `log_directory` and `Grid1_file_dir` with unique names to identify your simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convergence testing (4 points)\n",
    "Whenever we perform numerical simulations of continuous phenomena, we need to discretize both time and space. Although in the limit of infinite spatial and temporal resolution (and computers with infinite precision) we would expect our discrete model to match the continuous one, in practice we need to verify if the resolution used is appropriate for our work. This goes beyond stellar evolution simulations, and is a best practice for all types of numerical calculations that rely on discretization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of this lab we will compute the main sequence evolution of a $10M_\\odot$ star of metallicity Z=0.02 from ZAMS to TAMS, and evaluate the resulting mass of the helium core (contained in the output 'he_core_mass' of your history file, but also listed as `He_core` in the terminal output). We want to verify if our choice of resolution gives us a converged result by increasing it and checking by how much our results changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes on the inlist that is used in the template, to model stars from ZAMS, the following option is set in the `star_job` section of `inlist_project`:\n",

    "With this option MESA will make use of pre-computed ZAMS models to initiate the simulation, saving you a bit of time by avoiding the calculation of the pre main-sequence. Mesa has a large amount of options to compute spatial and temporal resolution, but also provides two convenience options to perform a global scaling of them. These are contained in the `controls` section of your `inlist_project`:\n",

    "    time_delta_coeff= 2d0\n",

    "/\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first of these options regulates the size of the grid, while the second regulates the size of the timesteps. The default value of these is one, and by setting both of these to two we will use bigger cells and take longer timesteps (thus, relaxing the resolution). Run this simulation a total of 4 times, with the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mesh_delta_coeff=2d0`, `time_delta_coeff=2d0`\n",

    "- `mesh_delta_coeff=0.25d0`, `time_delta_coeff=0.25d0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will represent a factor 8 in time and spatial resolution between the most and the least resolved simulation. With these simulations, answer the following questions for your report:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the resolution of your simulations behave as expected? Indicate the number of steps each simulation took, and see the number of zones by checking the `num_zones` column in your history file (you can take the value of the very last timestep).\n",
    "- If for a particular science case I would need to know the value of the helium core mass to a precision better than 1%, what choice of resolution option would you suggest? Of course we expect the highest resolution to be the most precise, but we want to balance simulation cost and precision. You can illustrate this by plotting the value of `he_core_mass` against the logarithm of the number of steps."
